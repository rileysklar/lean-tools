üé≤ FARKLE RULES ‚Äî STRUCTURED FORMAT FOR AGENTIC AI
1. OBJECTIVE
Be the first player to reach 10,000 points (or an agreed-upon alternate score).

Points are accumulated by rolling combinations with six 6-sided dice.

2. GAME COMPONENTS
6 standard six-sided dice.

Score sheet and writing utensil.

(Optional) Dice cup for each player.

3. NUMBER OF PLAYERS
Minimum: 2

Recommended: 3‚Äì8

4. TURN STRUCTURE (Clarified)
Each player performs the following during their turn:

Step 1: Roll all available dice (start with 6 dice).
Step 2: Check for scoring combinations. (See Section 5)
IMPORTANT: A roll must contain at least one scoring die (a 1 or a 5, or a scoring combination) ‚Äî otherwise, the turn ends immediately as a Farkle.

Step 3: Set aside at least one scoring die (1s, 5s, or valid combinations).
You may choose to set aside only some scoring dice, not all.

You must set aside at least one scoring die per roll to continue.

Step 4: Choose one:
Bank your accumulated points and end your turn, OR

Reroll remaining dice and repeat steps 2‚Äì4.

Step 5: Repeat until:
You bank your score voluntarily, OR

You roll no scoring dice (no 1s, no 5s, no valid combos) ‚Üí this is a Farkle.

Step 6: If no Farkle, add banked points to total score.
Step 7: Pass the dice to the next player (clockwise).
üí• DEFINITION: FARKLE
A Farkle occurs any time a player rolls the dice and does not roll any scoring dice (i.e. no 1s, no 5s, no three-of-a-kind, no straight, etc.).

When a player Farkles:

Their entire score for that turn is lost (even if points were previously accumulated).

The turn ends immediately.

The dice pass to the next player.

Rule Reminder for Agents: A player must roll at least one 1 or 5 (or other scoring combination) on every roll to avoid a Farkle and continue their turn.


Step 1: Roll all six dice.
Step 2: Check for scoring combinations. (See section 5)
Step 3: Set aside at least one scoring die (optional to set aside all).
Step 4: Choose:
Roll remaining dice, OR

Bank points and end turn.

Step 5: Repeat steps 1‚Äì4 until:
Player banks points voluntarily.

Farkle: Player rolls and no scoring dice appear, losing all unbanked points from that turn.

Step 6: Add banked points to total score.
Step 7: Pass dice clockwise to next player.
Special Case:
If all six dice score (‚ÄúHot Dice‚Äù), player may reroll all six and continue turn.
